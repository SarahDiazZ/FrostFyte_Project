<h2>Project Repository</h2>
<p>The <b><u><q>Jacob's Sprites for FrostFyte</q></u></b> section holds the art used for the program such as the sprites which are implemented in the game.</p>
<p>The <b><u><q>Platform Fighter Engine Src</q></u></b> section holds the code for the user interface/user experience, attacks, and everything that implemented with our Platform Fighter. The details within this section hold the code for how the user interface looks such as when a character is being chosen and the given button that help navigate the user through the game experience. It also hold the code for the attacks.</p>
<p><b><u><q>Frost Fyte version 0.0</q></u></b> implements the starter code which contains simple sprite actions of the sprite performing basic attacks. It also sets a default sprite and implements two stages: Jotun Warp Gate, and Speed Highway.</p>
<p><b><u><q>Frost Fyte version 01.1</q></u></b> implements more advance attacks that can be used mid-air for our player character Alex. A bug caught in this area was that when Alex tried to do an advanced attack the default sprite would show up. This also implemented small bug fixes for the basic and aerial attacks.</p>
<p><b><u><q>Frost Fyte version 02.2</q></u></b> updates the attacks to be more animated, and implements Smash Attacks. It also added more functionality to the User Interface in order to allow for more efficient play. Alex also got multiple costume changes.</p>
<p><b><u><q>Frost Fyte version 04.4</q></u></b> the last version implemented which tied together the system, updated all attacks and character costumes, and checked that the user interface was entirely compatible and clean making it easy to use.</p>
